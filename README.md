Lightweight Cross-Platform IDE using Electron.js

Introduction

Hey, I need you to build a lightweight yet powerful cross-platform IDE using Electron.js. It should have a modern UI, fast performance, and a professional look while keeping the size optimized.

ðŸ”¹ Core Features

1. Sidebar (Like VS Code)

Allows users to drag and drop a folder to open projects.

Displays a file explorer for easy navigation.

Supports creating, renaming, and deleting files/folders.

2. Code Editor (Feature-Rich)

Syntax highlighting for multiple languages (Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.).

Code folding: Users can collapse/expand functions, loops, and classes.

Line numbers displayed on the left.

Bracket/component matching line: A subtle guideline that visually connects the start and end of functions, loops, and components.

Indentation guides for clear code structure.

Multiple tabs support for opening multiple files.

Auto-closing brackets and quotes.

Word wrap toggle.

Drag-and-drop tab reordering.

3. Integrated Terminal (Like VS Code & PyCharm)

Built-in terminal that supports running shell and Python commands.

Users can run Python scripts or other commands inside the IDE.

Allows opening multiple terminal instances.

4. Menu Bar (Like VS Code & PyCharm)

File (New File, Open, Save, Close, Exit).

Edit (Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Find & Replace).

View (Toggle Sidebar, Show/Hide Line Numbers, Toggle Word Wrap).

Terminal (Open New Terminal, Clear Terminal).

Settings (Opens settings.json for theme customization).

5. Settings & Theme Customization

Clicking "Settings" opens a settings.json file where users can:

Change theme (dark/light/custom).

Modify font size, syntax colors, and editor layout.

Customize editor behavior (word wrap, auto-indent, bracket matching, etc.).

6. Search and Replace

Quick search bar for searching inside open files.

Find and replace feature with regex support.

7. Lightweight & Optimized

Uses Monaco Editor (the same editor used in VS Code) for a rich coding experience.

Electron should be optimized to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

ðŸ”¹ Bonus Features (Optional but Recommended)

Auto-completion using language server protocol (LSP).

Error and syntax checking for Python and JavaScript.

Git integration: Shows modified files, allows commits inside the IDE.

Split view: Open two files side by side.

Multi-cursor editing (like VS Code).

Drag-and-drop tab reordering.

Make sure the IDE is well-structured, modular, and scalable for future improvements. Thanks!
